Agent Instructions:

This project is being run locally on a windows machine. 

There is a production version also which is hosted on DigitalOcean droplet.

I'd like to keep both versions aligned as much as possible.

Commands should be powershell 7 compatible.

Docker Desktop is running.

The etc/hosts file is already set up to include amiarobot.ca as a local domain.

The project root directory is "C:\Users\jorda\coding_projects\Am_I_A_Robot".

Please give the full path of any commands that require user to be in a specific directory.

Please give commands one line at a time (instead of in a block), to make running them easier for me.

This project is being tracked with Git and uploaded to Github.
